## Hi! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub profile. I don't have a lot of public projects here, but I'm looking to make some. Thanks for stopping by!

### More about me:
I mainly code in Swift, developing iOS apps for my own personal use, but I also occasionally code in Python or develop small HTML sites. I'm always looking to learn more programming and more languages, and might look into making an app for the App Store one day.
